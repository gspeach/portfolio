This folder contains a tool for reading and writing to an XML file using AJAX. When a user clicks a link on the webpage.html page it is stored in the ajaxread.js file. The ajaxread.js file uses AJAX to search the urls file. If it finds the clicked url present it will return some values assigned to that url. If the clicked url is not found it will be sent to the phpwrite.php file using ajax. The phpwrite.php file will then use simple xml to write the url and values to the xml file. This tool can be used in many ways.
