Hello Visitor!

My name is George Speach and this is my personal GitHub repository. This repository serves as my own personal web development portfolio. In this repository you will find code examples I have created for work, school, or fun. Every code snippet or program will be in its own folder with a readme file. Please check the readme file if you have any questions about the code within the folder.

If you have any further questions feel free to contact me by email at georgebspeach@gmail.com.

Thank You,
George Speach
